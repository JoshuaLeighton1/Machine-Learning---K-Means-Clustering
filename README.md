# Machine-Learning---K-Means-Clustering

In this code, I wrote a function for the k means clustering algorithm from scratch instead of using the built in kmeans function. I also wrote a function that visualizes the clusters from scratch. This code takes in a CSV file, reads and depending on how many iterations the user asks, plots the k means accordingly.
